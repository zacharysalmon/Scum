# Scum

A card game that I grew up playing with my family is the inspiration for this game. Other names include President and Leader.

# How to play

1. Dealing - deal all cards evenly to each player

2. One person plays a card or group of cards, all of the same number. Then the player to their left (clockwise) has the chance to play higher card(s) or they pass to the next player. For groups of cards, all amounts need to be the same for each pile 
i.e. two 2's -> two 4's -> two 7's. 

3. If every player passes and the turn comes back to the player who put down the card on top, the pile is discarded, and that player gets to lead off.

4. Play continues until every player has run out of cards. The order which players finish determines the order for the next game, first out becomes the President, last out becomes the Scum.

Rules:

2's are low, Aces are high, Jokers are wild and can be played by themselves or within any grouping.
